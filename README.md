This repository is to house some of the C++ code I have worked on.

The accession2taxid is a work in progress but servers the purpose of taking an input fasta file and extracting the accession numbers. From these accession numbers the code will then go through the names and nodes dmp files associated with NCBI
and pull lookups on all of the taxID values and also attempt to provide all taxonomic information for each taxID found.
